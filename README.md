# Tic--Tac-Toe

a Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

This classic game helped me practice: âœ… DOM manipulation
âœ… JavaScript logic and event handling
âœ… Responsive design with CSS
âœ… Clean and interactive UI/UX

ðŸ§  Building this gave me a deeper understanding of how frontend components work together in a real-world project.
